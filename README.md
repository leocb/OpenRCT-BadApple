## Notes:

I would NOT consider this plugin production-ready. some key features are missing:
- I don't know what happens if the terrain is sloped
- I'm not showing a preview grid before placement
- The user can't select which small scenery item they want the animation to be played with
- The animation can't be rotated
- I don't know what happens to it if you close and reopen the park save
- Animation can't be stopped once playing
- Animation can be placed on top of another playing animation

Enjoy!
